Image Generator Application
Overview
This application generates images with random background colors and contrasting font colors, displaying a number at the center of each image. The images are saved to an images directory. The script is implemented in Python using the cv2, numpy, random, and os libraries.

Features
Randomized Backgrounds: Each image has a unique randomly generated background color.
Automatic Font Contrast: The app ensures optimal visibility by selecting a font color (black or white) that contrasts with the background color.
Centralized Numbering: Each image prominently displays a sequential number (0–50) in the center.
Batch Generation: Automatically generates and saves a batch of numbered images.
Usage
Save the code as a .py file (e.g., generate_images_with_python.py).
Run the script in a Python 3 environment with the required libraries installed.
Generated images will be saved in an images directory within the current working folder.
Code Explanation
1. Modules
cv2: For image creation and text overlay.
random: For generating random RGB values.
numpy: For creating and manipulating image arrays.
os: For file and directory handling.
2. Functions
generate_image(number, background_color, font_color)
Creates a 500x500-pixel image with the specified background and font colors. A number is centered on the image using OpenCV's putText() function.

save_image(image, filename)
Saves an image to the images directory, creating the directory if it doesn’t already exist.

generate_contrasting_color(background_color)
Calculates the brightness of the background color to determine a contrasting font color:

Bright background → Black font (0, 0, 0)
Dark background → White font (255, 255, 255)
3. Main Loop
Iterates through numbers 0–50.
For each iteration:
Generates a random background color (R, G, B).
Computes a contrasting font color using generate_contrasting_color().
Creates an image with generate_image().
Saves the image as image_<number>.png using save_image().
Example Output
images/image_0.png
images/image_1.png
images/image_2.png
...and so on, up to images/image_50.png.
Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

OpenCV (cv2): Install with pip install opencv-python
NumPy: Install with pip install numpy
Enhancements
Possible improvements for future versions:

Add CLI arguments for custom image dimensions, number ranges, and font sizes.
Allow custom directory paths for saving images.
Provide options for more advanced font styles and additional text formatting.
