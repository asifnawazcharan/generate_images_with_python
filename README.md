# Image Generator Application

### Overview
This application generates images with random background colors and contrasting font colors, displaying a number at the center of each image. The images are saved to an images directory. The script is implemented in Python using the cv2, numpy, random, and os libraries.

### Features
Randomized Backgrounds: Each image has a unique randomly generated background color.
Automatic Font Contrast: The app ensures optimal visibility by selecting a font color (black or white) that contrasts with the background color.
Centralized Numbering: Each image prominently displays a sequential number (0â€“50) in the center.
Batch Generation: Automatically generates and saves a batch of numbered images.

### Usage
Save the code as a .py file (e.g., generate_images_with_python.py).
Run the script in a Python 3 environment with the required libraries installed.
Generated images will be saved in an images directory within the current working folder.
