# generate_images_with_python

This code generates images, each with a random background color and a contrasting font color. The images are saved to the images directory.

The code first imports the cv2, random, numpy, and os modules. 

The generate_image() function takes three arguments: the number, the background color, and the font color. The function generates an image with the number in the center of the image. The background color and font color are passed as arguments to the function.

The save_image() function takes two arguments: the image and the filename. The function saves the image to a file with the given filename.

The generate_contrasting_color() function takes one argument: the background color. The function generates a contrasting font color for the background color. The function works by calculating the brightness of the background color. If the brightness is less than 128, the function returns white as the font color. Otherwise, the function returns black as the font color.

The for loop iterates multiple times. In each iteration, the loop generates a random background color, a contrasting font color, and an image. The image is then saved to a file.

To run the code, you can save it as a .py file and then run it from the command line.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
